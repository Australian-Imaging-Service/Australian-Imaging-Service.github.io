# Australian Imaging Service

### Project
As part of the ARDC 2019 Project's scheme, we are building a distributed, national federation for securely managing and analyzing imaging data for research, with a focus on radiology and biomedical applications. 

Universities and clinical sites across Australia are struggling to manage large volumes of imaging data, while balancing patient privacy and the need for sharing and accessibility in the research community. The Australian Imaging Service will transform the imaging and radiology sector by leveraging institutional investments and providing enhanced data management and analysis. The distributed federation will consist of multiple institutional deployments linked with a federated search layer, common community practice, support for expanded data types and a Trusted Tool Repository ensuring ongoing ownership and accountability of data.
