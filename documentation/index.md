# AIS Documentation project

## Background

Due to the number of systems and audiences involved, the current documentation 
plan is for the canonical documentation to be within the Github repository, 
using GitHub pages.

This provides a number of easy to use tools and systems to help keep 
standardised, versions and readable documentation.

## Strategy

 - main AIS documentation to be at the top level [https://australian-imaging-service.github.io/](https://australian-imaging-service.github.io/)
 - each repository will self document  
 - using [submodules](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/using-submodules-with-github-pages) the documentation for each repository will be integrated into the main documentation, which link out to the repositories as necessary - see the [repository list](repositories) for examples.


## Documentation

- should be written in Markdown
- should be in a directory called docs in the top level of the repository. We have chosen this methodology as it allows for versioned documentation that matches the code base.
- each repository will need to visit settings, scroll down to the Github Pages section, and make the necessary changes.
- either add themselves to the main site or ask an administrator to add them.
